# delaunay_3d
Uses some basic linear algebra for viewing points with 3D coordinates and navigating around them. An algorithm that takes advantage of the relationship between Delaunay tetrahedralizations and Voronoi diagrams approximates the tetrahedralization with O(n log n) complexity on the number of points.
